### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned
I've learnt that things aren't always what they seem to be. Orginally, I started this project with the intention to use css grid for layout but it didn't work out and I switched over to Flexbox. 

### Continued development
I'm deeply intrgued by flexbox and also CSS Grid and will continue my development journey with these concepts. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://www.example.com) - This website helped me to gain a deeper understanding of:
   -CSS Grid
   -Flexbox 
   -Media Queries
I would recommend it to anyone that is trying to learn anyone of these concepts.
